	Richard Kollmar, the son of a businessman, was born in Brooklyn on 31st December, 1910. A rebellious child, he was sent to a school for problem boys in New Jersey. Later he attended Tusculum College in Tennessee. It was while he was a student he became involved in acting and won a place at Yale Dramatic School. In 1938 Kollmar obtained a leading role in Knickerbocker Holiday. This was followed by the musical, Too Many Girls. The New York Times described him as "an exuberant comedian unspoiled by cleverness". Kollmar married Dorothy Kilgallen in April, 1940. The couple had three children (Jill, Richard and Kerry). He starred as the title character on the syndicated radio show "Boston Blackie" (1945-1949). 
	In April 1945 the couple began a daily morning radio show, Breakfast with Dorothy and Dick. The program went out live: Monday to Saturday (8.15 to 8.55 a.m.) and Sunday (11.30 to 12.00). Over the years the program was gradually commercialized. Companies paid to have their products mentioned over breakfast and theater producers arranged to have their plays and musicals discussed over breakfast. Films and books were also promoted by the hosts. Kollmar also worked as a theater producer. This included Early to Bed, By Jupiter, Leave It to the Girls and Dream With Music. He also owned and operated a nightclub in New York City called The Left Bank. He worked closely with the Arts Students League and started a small art gallery.
	Richard Kollmar committed suicide on 7th January, 1971.
