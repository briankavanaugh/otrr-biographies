Death: May 23, 1990, Gleneden Beach, Oregon

Elliott Lewis first made himself known as an actor, writer, producer and director on radio in the late 1930's. He had left New York and gone out to the West Coast to study law. Instead, he began working in radio playing "tough guys". His Manhattan accent lended well to the roles he played and within a year he was in high demand.

Lewis entered into the Armed Forces Radio during World War 2. By the end of the war, he was a Master Sergeant and a Newlywed. 

After working together for years on such shows as Suspense and Sam Spade, Cathy (Elliott's wife) and Elliott created On Stage in 1953. At the time, the Lewis' were two of the busiest people on the air and were known as  Mr. and Mrs. Radio. 

In contrast to his prodigious radio career, in which he worked either alone or with Cathy, his movie career, like those of most radio actors of the period, wasn't nearly as prolific, with only three films to his credit. 

As the 1950s wore on, he drifted away from acting to concentrate on the writing, producing and directing end of the business. After the 'Golden Age of Radio' ended, Lewis moved to TV as a producer of such shows as "Lucille Ball Show, The" (1962) and "The Mothers-In-Law" (1967), and director of all but one episode of the final season of "Petticoat Junction" (1963). He also served as a script doctor on the show "Remington Steele".  however, radio remained his first love, and he continued to direct the occasional radio play well into the 1970s.

Elliott Lewis passed away from heart trouble in 1990.
